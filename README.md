Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!


## Project Description

This is the first step in building an Airbnb clone web application. In this step, we will create a command interpreter to manage Airbnb objects. This command interpreter will be used as the foundation for the entire project, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows you to perform various actions on Airbnb objects, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them. It also provides helpful commands like `help` and `quit`.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run `./console.py` in your terminal.

### How to Use

Once the interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

- `create`: Create a new Airbnb object.
- `show`: Retrieve information about an object.
- `update`: Update the attributes of an object.
- `destroy`: Delete an object.
- `all`: List all objects or objects of a specific class.
- `quit` or `EOF`: Exit the program.
